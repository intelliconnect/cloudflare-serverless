# Steps to run the project

## set up the wrangler cli

> you can follow [this](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide) tutorial or use below commands.

```bash

# for npm users
npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler

# for yarn users
yarn global add @cloudflare/wrangler

# check if it's installed correctly
wrangler --version

# login to your account
wrangler login
```

## clone this repository

```bash
# clone this repo
git clone git@github.com:intelliconnect/cloudflare-serverless.git

# change to the project directory
cd cloudflare-serverless
```

## get your account id

> get your account id from your dashbord or use below command.

```bash
wrangler whoami

ðŸ‘‹  You are logged in with an API Token, associated with the email '<Your Email>'.

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Account Name                     | Account ID                       |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Your Account                     | $yourAccountId                   |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
```

put this account id into wrangler.toml file.

```text
# wrangler.toml

name = "my-wrangler-app"
type = "javascript"
workers_dev = true
compatibility_date = "2022-01-27"
account_id = "enter your account id"
```

## create a kv store

> you can use [this](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tutorials/workers-kv-from-rust) tutorial for more details.

```bash
# create kv store with name KV_FROM_RUST
wrangler kv:namespace create "KV_FROM_RUST"

add the following to the configuration file:

kv_namespaces = [
          { binding = "KV_FROM_RUST", id= "5ff0fd9d0e4d4a409243630e9e9ef03c" }
]
```

add the above config to wrangler.toml

## get the Data api secret key for mongodb

Goto the mongodb dashboard. in the left navigation bar under data service click on the Data API link.
create a API key and ***store it somewhere secure*** since, it will appear only once and it has access to the database.

***In the lib.rs file change the lines 44-46 and 58-60 with your cluster name, database name and the collection name.***

### create a secret in wrangler to store the secret key

> we will create a secret in wrangler to store the Data API key.

```bash
# create a secret with name mongo_data_api_key
wrangler secret put mongo_data_api_key

# it will ask for secret key paste it and press enter

```

store the name of the key in wrangler.toml file and comment it out. it's just for refrence purpose.

```toml
# [SECRETS] (this is just for refrence)
# mongo_data_api_key
```

## running the project

```bash
# compiles your project to WebAssembly and will warn of any issues
wrangler build 

# run your Worker in an ideal development workflow (with a local server, file watcher & more)
wrangler dev

# access the endpoint at 127.0.0.1:8787
# test the endpoint
curl 127.0.0.1:8787
#should return: Hello from Workers!


# post json data to the mongodb with POST request to 127.0.0.1:8787/mongo_post and the json body to post
# get the data from mongodb with GET request to 127.0.0.1:8787/mongo

# deploy your Worker globally to the Cloudflare network (update your wrangler.toml file for configuration)
wrangler publish

# after publishing your url will be like my-wrangler-app.{your subdomain}.workers.dev

```

when the workers_dev field in wrangler.toml is true, it is published to *.workers.dev domain.

to publish it to a registered domain refer [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide#optional-configure-for-deploying-to-a-registered-domain).

## To create a new project for cloudflare in rust

```bash
# you can replace my-wrangler-app with your app name
wrangler generate my-wrangler-app https://github.com/cloudflare/rustwasm-worker-template
```
